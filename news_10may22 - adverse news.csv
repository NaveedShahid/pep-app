The Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights, which met here with Senator Walid Iqbal in the chair, to take cognisance of the registration of FIRs over the sloganeering against Pakistan’s official delegation during their pilgrimage to Masjid-i-Nabwi.
Following the incident in question, a couple of FIRs were registered against PTI chairman Imran Khan and some other party leaders, including MNA Rashid Shafique, who was arrested and jailed. However, he was released on Monday on bail.
The committee chairman said it was unfortunate that the incident of sloganeering took place in Saudi Arabia but cases were registered here in Pakistan against political leaders.
Apology more appropriate than filing an FIR, says HRCP
During the meeting, a council member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) strongly condemned the fake and frivolous accusation of blasphemy being used for political victimisation and termed it among the first few examples where the law was being used for political scoring.
HRCP’s Nasreen Azhar said that an apology, if such an incident has occurred at the Masjid-i-Nabwi, is more appropriate than filing an FIR, as that would not provoke the sentiments of the general public.
Representatives from various institutions also exchanged views on the measures to eliminate the misuse of the blasphemy law and suggested that amendments be made to the law to discourage such accusations. The committee was informed that 580 cases under accusation of blasphemy were filed last year, which is an increase of 100 per cent.
A police working paper, which was presented before the committee, stated that FIRs were registered under sections 295, 295A, and 296 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) involving offences related to blasphemy laws. The police said that FIRs were registered under section 4 of the PPC, which states that any offence committed by any citizen of Pakistan or any place outside and beyond Pakistan is subject to FIR.
At the meeting, Federal Minister for Human Rights Riaz Hussain Pirzada said that former prime minister Imran Khan is rightly saying that his life is in danger after the blasphemy charges.
He urged the chairman of the committee not to highlight this issue too much and to keep it low profile, for the safety of the accused. Senator Kamran Michael also condemned the misuse of blasphemy laws in the country, stating that the committee should not only highlight the issues of those who are nominated in the two FIRs, but this is the time to take up the issues of all those people in this country who have faced or are facing allegations of blasphemy.
Earlier, officials from the Ministry of Interior suggested that the committee give directions to refer the matter to the Foreign Office through Pakistan’s mission in Saudi Arabia, to obtain clarity on the matter.
During the course of the meeting, officers of Punjab Police informed the committee that two FIRs, one each in Faisalabad and Attock, were registered in connection with the Madina incident.The committee chairman sought more details on the data and statistics of the FIRs registered at the next meeting. The Faisalabad administration assured the committee that further investigation into the matter of FIRs would be dealt with in accordance with the law and with considerable care. The Senate committee decided to seek further details and postpone the matter till the next meeting, to be held on May 16.

WARSAW: The Russian ambassador to Poland was splattered with a red substance by pro-Ukraine activists in Warsaw on Monday when he tried to lay a wreath to mark the Victory Day.
Victory Day is celebrated annually on May 9 to commemorate the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. This year’s events are taking place as Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine enters its third month.
“In Warsaw, during the laying of a wreath at the cemetery of Soviet soldiers, an attack was carried out on the Russian ambassador to Poland, Sergei Andreev, and the Russian diplomats accompanying him,” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Telegram.
“The admirers of neo-Nazism have again shown their faces,” she said, repeating Russia’s assertion that it is fighting neo-Nazis in Ukraine.
Sergei Andreev unhurt after being accosted by pro-Ukraine activists in Warsaw
Chanting “fascists” and brandishing the yellow-blue national flag, pro-Ukraine activists blocked the ambassador’s way as he walked toward the mausoleum, preventing him from laying the wreath, according to an AFP photographer at the scene.
Several individuals then threw a red substance on his face and clothes, and also splattered some of the men in his entourage.
After wiping his face with his hand, Andreev said “I am proud of my country and my president”.
Andreev told Russian news agency RIA Novosti that he was not seriously harmed in the attack, adding that the red substance was some sort of syrup.
The Russian embassy had planned to hold an official ceremony at the site but cancelled after a negative response from Warsaw’s mayor and the foreign ministry.
But Andreev still showed up with his wreath, as did individual Russians throughout the morning, while pro-Ukrainian protesters held up a big sign that said “criminals” and displayed photos of the war-torn country.
After the incident, Russia’s foreign ministry said it had protested to Polish officials “regarding their indulgence of young neo-Nazis”.
“Russia has demanded that Poland organise without delay the wreath-laying ceremony while providing complete security in the face of all sorts of provocations,” it said in a statement.
Poland has accepted hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighbouring Ukraine since Moscow sent troops into the country on February 24.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1688930/sc-vexed-by-criticism-on-unfavourable-judgements,2022-05-10,dawn,national,SC vexed by criticism on unfavourable judgements,"ISLAMABAD: Justice Ijazul Ahsan of the Supreme Court on Monday expressed his dismay over the tendency of discrediting institutions like the judiciary, saying it did not behove someone to insinuate something merely because a certain judgement did not please them.
“This is the Supreme Court where aggrieved parties come to seek justice,” observed Justice Ahsan, who is a member of a five-judge Supreme Court (SC) bench hearing the presidential reference seeking interpretation of Article 63A of the Constitution that dealt with defection.
Pointing towards Advocate Babar Awan, who was representing Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), Justice Ahsan told him to “just think about it”.
The observation came a day after the media wing of the armed forces took exception to defamatory remarks made by various political parties against the military and its leadership.
CJP says suo motu exercised after lot of thought, not merely on someone’s wishes
“This is an institutional reaction from the judiciary after the military’s response,” commented a senior counsel on condition of anonymity.
Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, who was heading the five-judge SC bench, also observed that the court was not condemning the client of the counsel, but one should learn how the system worked, saying the jurisdiction of the apex court did not get invoked automatically by lodging protest before the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) or writing letters.
The CJP also wondered why no petition or complaint was ever moved if the parties thought the decision on the Senate elections was not implemented.
“We are not an executive agency and expect action only on petitions or a case before it,” the chief justice observed, emphasising that the traditional function of the Supreme Court was to deliver post-facto decisions.
“We don’t take anticipatory actions,” Justice Bandial explained, making it clear that the apex court had curtailed the practice of invoking suo motu jurisdiction since it should be exercised with great caution because parties never supported or defended it.
The court did not exercise suo motu jurisdiction simply on someone’s wishes rather after a lot of pondering and discussion over its exercise, the chief justice observed, reminding that the apex court had taken the last suo motu in the speaker’s ruling case after 12 judges concluded that the court should step in since a constitutional issue had developed.
Gradually with practice we will settle down principles on how to deal with the exercise of suo motu jurisdiction, Justice Bandial observed and referred to a recent judgement of Justice Munib Akhtar who had explained that the authority to exercise suo motu power vested only with the CJP.
The Constitution unites the federation, and the apex court being the defender of the Constitution would continue to defend it and serve the people despite the fact that it may have to counter criticism, Chief Justice Bandial said.
Referring to what transpired in the Riko Diq episode — a case also taken on suo motu and in which the international arbitration slapped $6 billion penalty on Pakistan — the chief justice observed that senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan had told the court that none of the evidence which were presented before the SC during the hearing on the award of the contract to the Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan (TCCP) was ever cited before the international arbitration.
“What happened in the Pakistan Steel Mills case,” the CJP wondered, adding that people think we were not cognisant of the outcome of cases. He regretted that in such matters, the executive failed to perform its duties.
The chief justice made it clear that the Supreme Court had to interpret Article 63A for the generations to come since the Constitution was a living document.
When Babar Awan said he would argue his case while remaining within the confines of good behaviour and mannerism, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel reminded him that since he had referred to good behaviour, it should also be disseminated to the people that it was not the Supreme Court which opened late in the evening, rather a case had been heard in Quetta at 2:30am in the night. The counsel, however, replied that he did not want to go into such matters.
At the outset, Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman told the court that the new attorney general of Pakistan (AGP), Ashtar Ausaf — whose appointment was notified by the government later in the evening — might also want to argue.
He said since references had already been sent to the ECP against those who were perceived to have defected and their appeals might come to the apex court, therefore the court should consider giving its determination on the matter on those appeals.
But the chief justice explained that the court did not have the required manpower to constitute a larger bench for such appeals, adding that these appeals would be placed before a three-judge bench.
The chief justice observed that the court would determine the reference on the question of law, adding that it was its responsibility to interpret the Constitution.
The Supreme Court also issued notice to the National Assembly speaker and the ECP in the petition moved by the PTI and argued by Babar Awan.
It should be examined whether Article 63A of the Constitution has the ethos that go beyond the consequence of commission of defection or needed a holistic interpretation of the Constitution, the court observed.
When Babar Awan mentioned about a vilification campaign against President Dr Arif Alvi, saying that the president was ignoring it since he was a learned person and honourable man, the SC chief justice said the court always gave respect to the constitutional institution, especially the office of president, adding that the counsel should bring it to the notice of the court through petitions.
“Don’t you see how much importance the court is according to the presidential reference,” Justice Bandial said.
During the hearing, Advocate Azhar Siddique also expressed the fear that the new AGP might withdraw the presidential reference.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1688929/criticism-meant-against-sharifs-not-army-imran,2022-05-10,dawn,national,"Criticism meant against Sharifs, not army: Imran","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Monday claimed he had used the words, Mir Jaffar and Mir Sadiq, for the Sharif brothers and rejected the allegation that he had criticised Pakistan Army in his speech in Abbottabad.
The former prime minister also claimed he was doing jihad rather than politics and advised party leaders to ensure that none of the PTI lawmakers, whose mass resignations were being verified by the National Assembly speaker, attend the NA session as the PTI’s only demand was early elections.
While speaking to party leaders, Mr Khan said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was wrongly blaming him for “hatching a grand conspiracy against Pakistan”. The premier accused his predecessor of maligning national institutions, constitution and state during his speech. He warned that legal action would be taken, adding what Mr Khan had been doing could only be called “conspiracy” not against political rivals but against the country.
Also on Sunday, the military and civil authorities took notice of attempts to “drag the army” into the political quagmire, passing “defamatory” remarks against the institution and its leadership and “spreading chaos” in the country through political statements, comments and social media trends. Both the ISPR and the FIA issued separate statements, urging resident and overseas Pakistanis to refrain from such practices. The army had taken a “strong exception” to “intensified and deliberate attempts” to drag its name into the country’s ongoing discourse by “some political leaders, journalists and analysts.
Asks party leaders to ensure none among MNAs who resigned en masse attends assembly session
Mr Khan, however, said Mr Sharif was giving the impression as if he had disgraced the army while actually he had “used words Mir Jaffar and Mir Sadiq for the Sharif brothers”.
“Elder brother [Nawaz Sharif] use to speak against the Army and his daughter [Maryam Nawaz] is also attacking Army. On the other hand, Shehbaz Sharif says he is defending Army. Today India is more than happy because the people who used to meet Narendra Modi without announcing meetings have come to power,” the PTI chairman said.
Claiming that he was doing jihad rather than politics, Mr Khan said he would give a call after May 20 for a long march towards Islamabad. “Every person should participate in the march and those who cannot travel to Islamabad, they should protest in their own cities. Those who were elected to the assembly shall visit their constituencies and bring people to Islamabad and those without constituencies should stay in Islamabad. It would not be difficult to bring people, as people want direction rather than Qeemay Wala Naan,” he told his party leaders.
He said that overseas Pakistanis working 18 hours a day sent $32 billion a year to Pakistan but the corrupt leaders sent it back through money laundering. “I have never seen a three times prime minister of a country who lives in affluent area of Mayfair in London,” he remarked.
Referring to the hooliganism during the visit of cabinet members to Masjid-i-Nabwi, Mr Khan criticised “those who went to Saudi Arabia” and said they should have sta­­yed back as they were required more in Pakistan. He said that the government was calling legislators who had resigned from the National Assembly (for verification) and asked his party leaders to ensure that no one would attend the NA session as PTI only wants early elections.
PTI leader Ali Awan told Dawn Mr Khan has directed parliamentary members not to appear before the NA speaker for verification of resignations. He said that Usman Buzdar’s resignation, which was written to the PM, was accepted. “However resignations already accepted by [NA] deputy spea­ker are not being accepted. We have been advised not to appear before speaker as it is mockery on the constitution,” he said.
‘Insult to parliament’
Criticising the passage of a resolution against Mr Khan, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said it was passed by an “occupied assembly”, terming the resolution an “insult to the parliament”.
Mr Chaudhry said Mr Sharif had claimed cases would be lodged against Mr Khan while in another statement the PM advised the authorities not to take the statements of Maryam Nawaz seriously. “ISPR had to issue a press release because Maryam Nawaz had given a statement against Corps Commander. Imran Khan has already mentioned that if Army becomes weak Pakistan will become weak,” he added.
Also, PTI Information Secretary Farrukh Habib said Ms Nawaz was “habitual of attacking armed forces” and her father invited Narendra Modi to attend a marriage ceremony in Pakistan.

Justice Mohammad Tariq Nadeem of the LHC was hearing a habeas corpus petition seeking recovery of Bebgar Imdad, a student of an Islamabad university, who was allegedly picked up by security agencies from a hostel of Punjab University (PU) where he was visiting his relative.
On the court’s directive, a report was submitted on behalf of the capital city police saying an investigation team of the CTD took Imdad into custody for investigation into the suicide blast at KU.
The report said PU chief security officer retired Col Abdullah was contacted by the Lahore police for verification of an application filed against the alleged abduction. However, it said, the security officer confirmed the arrest of the student by the CTD.
The report said the security officer assisted the police team to arrest the student from the PU hostel.
Counsel for the petitioner Asad Jamal after going through the police report, raised various legal questions on the arrest and transfer of the student from Lahore to Karachi.
He argued that there were some legal requirements the CTD-Karachi was supposed to meet before arresting the student and shifting him to another station.
The counsel said the Karachi police were required to seek permission from the Punjab home department to make any arrest in the province.
He said that not only the arrest of the student but his shifting to Karachi without seeking a transit remand from a court of law was also illegal.
The judge adjourned further hearing till Tuesday (today) and directed the police to apprise the court whether the legal requirements were fulfilled before the arrest of the petitioner’s cousin.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1688824/shc-seeks-advice-on-centres-authority-to-obtain-gas-without-sindhs-permission,2022-05-10,dawn,karachi,SHC seeks advice on Centre’s authority to obtain gas without Sindh’s permission,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Monday appointed an amicus curie to assist it on whether federal government has legal authority to take natural gas from Sindh without its permission after the petroleum ministry insisted that federal government had exclusively competent to make or revise any policy about gas.
A federal law officer argued that the federal government can take natural gas from Sindh without consent of the province notwithstanding Article 158 of the Constitution.
During the previous hearing, the SHC had directed the petroleum secretary to come up with his detailed response setting out a legal basis for the federal government to provide natural gas to other provinces from Sindh without its consent after he had submitted that the federal government did not need any permission from Sindh government in this regard.
When the two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha took up the matter for hearing on Monday, a deputy attorney general filed a report on behalf of the petroleum secretary.
Senior lawyer Makhdoom Ali Khan appointed amicus curie
The ministry contended that since the subject of natural gas was included in the federal legislative list, the federal government was exclusively competent to make and revise any policy with regard to natural gas.
It further asserted that unlike Articles 153, 154, 155, 160 and 161 of the Constitution which provided an inbuilt self-adjudicatory and self-executory mechanism, the Article 158 spoke of a policy and did not provide guidelines for any such self-executory mechanism as has already been acknowledged by the Supreme Court in a case “Gadoon Textile Mills versus WAPDA”.
The ministry in its reply further submitted that several petroleum policies were approved by federal government from time to time and the 2012 petroleum policy was approved by the Council of Common Interests (CCI) which provided a mechanism for the sale and purchase of natural gas in the country and also authorised the federal government to allow E&P companies to enter into contractual arrangement for sale of gas to third party customers other than residential and commercial consumers.
The bench in its order said that the ministry of petroleum had filed its report and according to the DAG, it gave reasons as to why the federal government could and had taken gas from government of Sindh without its permission notwithstanding Article 158.
It appointed senior lawyer Makhdoom Ali Khan as amicus curie to assist the court on some facts, particularly on federal government’s authority of taking gas from Sindh without permission of its government and whether the CCI had any role in this regard.
While putting off the hearing till Aug 22, the bench said that the amicus curie would also assist the court about the legal validity of the contents of the report filed by the petroleum secretary.
It also summoned the Sui Southern Gas Company general manager (distribution) Abdul Waheed along with report after it was informed that funds could not be utilised for his failure to issue tender notices within time.
Gasification of villages
The bench also directed the federal finance secretary to ensure release of second tranche of funds amounting to Rs660 million in the next financial year to the SSGC within two months for gasification of villages.
The bench issued such directives while hearing around 10 identical petitions regarding non-provision of gasification and welfare funds for the villagers located within five kilometres radius of each exploration and production site in Sindh despite Supreme Court’s directives issued in December 2013.

The recovered gold and amount was kept in the public treasury under the custody of ASI Mubashir Iqbal. Later, Iqbal stole the gold and cash and on Monday the ACE arrested him and registered a case against him.

Our job is to curb corruption, not to humiliate the citizens. Strict action will be taken against the officers who have registered bogus FIRs against innocent people,” the DG said.
He said necessary changes were being made in the anti-corruption laws and rules to enhance the efficiency of the department, and the services of a legal firm also being hired for the purpose.

Rizwan went on long leave just before the formation of the PMLN-led coalition government and was later transferred from the office of FIA Lahore director last month. His name was also placed on the no-fly list.
According to a family member, Mr Rizwan, 47, suffered a cardiac arrest in the early hours on Monday and he was shifted to hospital where he was pronounced dead. His funeral will be held here on Tuesday (today).
Mr Rizwan belonged to the police service and had the rank of DIG. During his posting as FIA Lahore chief Mr Rizwan also probed into money laundering and market manipulation charges against sugar baron Jahangir Khan Tareen (who is currently supporting the ruling PML-N) and former federal industries Khusro Bakhtiar and his family members and two sugar mills of media houses.
The FIA investigators under Mr Rizwan had detected Rs110 billion earning by the sugar mafia during the PTI rule through ‘speculative pricing’. Further action in the sugar scam was halted due to political reasons.
In the money laundering probe, the investigation team under Mr Rizwan had detected 28 benami accounts of the Shehbaz family through which money laundering of over Rs14bn was committed during 2008-18. The money (Rs14bn) received from the accounts of low-wage employees by Shehbaz was transferred outside Pakistan via hundi/hawala networks, ultimately destined for beneficial use of his family members, according to the FIA.
Former prime minister Imran Khan expressed his condolences over the death of Mr Rizwan. “Saddened to learn of the passing of Dr Rizwan one of the most upright & courageous officers who withstood pressure while investigation & preparing the Rs 16 bn money laundering case against Crime Minister SS. My condolences & prayers go to his family,” Khan said in a tweet.

Additional District and Sessions Judge Malik Muhammad Mushtaq had allowed acquittal applications of both on April 29.
Akbari Gate police had registered a first information report (FIR) against the duo under section 295 of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) following a court direction to act on an application of a lawyer as per law and decide whether a cognizable offence was made out.
The section deals with the offence of injuring or defiling a place of worship, with intent to insult the religion of any class.
Advocate Farhat Manzoor Chandio, the complainant, pleaded that the duo trampled upon the sanctity of the mosque by their act which also sparked an outrage among the public.
Earlier, a judicial magistrate had dismissed the acquittal applications of the suspects on March 3.
Both had filed appeals before the sessions court.
The detailed order released by the court says to make an offence under section 295 of the PPC against a person, it is necessary that the person should have the intention of insulting the religion of any class of person, which is missing in this case.
“Mere defilement of a place of worship is not punishable under this section. There must be an intention of thereby insulting the religion of any class of person,” the order adds.
It observes that nothing has been collected by the police during the investigation to the effect that the petitioners intentionally damaged, defiled or disrespected the place of worship, rather they being artists joined a shooting with a prior permission.
The judge set aside the magistrate’s decision and acquitted both artists, allowing their acquittal applications.

Hearing a petition filed by former information minister Fawad Chaudhry, in which he asked the court to restrain the police from arresting PTI leaders nominated in over a dozen first information reports (FIRs) registered in connection with Masjid-i-Nabwi incident, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah asked the counsel representing PTI to seek instruction from the party leadership whether it reposed confidence in the judiciary or otherwise.
“It appears from the public statements made by the petitioner and political leaders of PTI in public meetings that probably they have doubts regarding the independence and impartiality of this court [IHC],” Justice Minallah observed.
The IHC chief justice was referring to PTI leadership’s criticism on opening of the Supreme Court and the IHC on the evening of April 9 as if it was an extraordinary act.
Justice Minallah says it appears from party leaders’ statement they had doubts about IHC’s impartiality
He remarked that “it is a constitutional duty of a court and every judge to decide cases in accordance with law. However, simultaneously, it is also the duty of a court to ensure that justice is not only done, but is also seen to have been done,” adding that “in case there is doubt in the mind of a litigant regarding the independence and impartiality of a court or a judge, then justice cannot be seen to have been done.”
However doubt ought to be based on the basis of reasonable grounds, the court noted.
Justice Minallah rejected the political narrative regarding the events on the evening of April 9, terming it “misconceived”.
He reminded that the IHC during PTI’s 2014 sit-in had issued a restraining order against the arrest of dozens of its workers late at night.
Justice Minallah remarked that the court sometimes entertained the petitions of urgent nature even after the notified timings, adding that, “nonetheless, neither the august Supreme Court nor this court had held any proceedings nor orders were passed in the evening of April 9”.
Notwithstanding that no proceedings had caused any prejudice to the petitioners or the PTI leaders, it is of utmost importance that they have trust and confidence in the independence and impartiality of the court, he added.
The counsel representing PTI assured the IHC chief justice that they had confidence in the court, but Justice Minallah still preferred that they seek instructions from the petitioners and the party leadership.
“The counsel, therefore, are expected to inform the court on the date fixed, after seeking instructions, whether the petitioners and the leadership of PTI repose confidence in the court to proceed with the petitions in hand,” the court order stated.
The hearing in the case was adjourned till May 12. The bail granting order to Shahbaz Gill was also extended to the said date.
Police in various cities, including the federal capital, had registered FIRs against former prime minister Imran Khan, Fawad Chaudhry, Shahbaz Gill, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, Sheikh Rashid Shafique and others under section 295 (defiling the place of worship) and 296 (disturbing religious assembly) of the Pakistan Panel Code (PPC) over Masjid-i-Nabwi incident.
Fawad Chaudhry and Shahbaz Gill had filed the petition through advocate Faisal Hussain Chaudhry, Mohammad Ali Bokhari and other advocates seeking multiple relief including avoid of arrest.
Though, the court was closed on account of Eid holidays, as per the court’s practice a skeleton staff was present to entertain the petitions related to enforcement of fundamental rights.

The decision came when PTI counsel argued before a bench of the ECP that the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had barred the commission from taking a decision about the appeals.
He said a copy of the order had been applied for, which in all probability will be received in the next two days and the case will be taken up for hearing by the IHC on June 8.

Talking to reporters later, PML-N lawyer Jehangir Jadoon said the PML-N had submitted all details of donations received by it, none of which were from prohibited sources.
He said the PTI will submit its objections to the documents.
PTI leader Farrukh Habib accused both PML-N and PPP of concealing multiple bank accounts from the ECP.

He added that the PML-N tried to hide behind legal technicalities that were not applicable to matters beyond five years.
While pointing out that applications against PML-N and PPP had been filed in 2018, he said the law must be equally applied to all parties and PTI must not be discriminated against.
He was of the view that the scrutiny committee should submit its reports about cases against PML-N and PPP as soon as possible.

Earlier in the day, the judicial magistrate Malik Arif had reserved the verdict after listening to the arguments by the lawyer of the MNA.
The lawyer said the incident took place in Saudi Arabia, but the case was registered in Pakistan, which is nothing but a political revenge. The lawyer further said neither the prime minister nor the information minister were plaintiff in the case.
On May 2, the court rejected the police demand, seeking extension in physical remand and sent Sheikh Rashid Shafique to jail on 14 days judicial remand.
A heavy contingent of police was deployed at the main gate of the district court during the hearing on Monday.
PTI workers, present on the court premises, were chanting slogans. Mr Rahid was arrested by the New Airport police of Attock district on his return from Saudi Arabia on May 1.
He was given to police for a day but later it was extended for two days on May 2. On the third hearing on May 4, the counsel for the police again pleaded for another three days remand.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1688851/hanif-abbasi-not-entitled-to-hold-public-office-ihc,2022-05-10,dawn,islamabad,Hanif Abbasi not entitled to hold public office: IHC,"ISLAMABAD: The local PML-N leader Hanif Abbasi is in hot waters as the Islamabad High Court (IHC) observed that being a convict he is not entitled to hold the public office.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah, hearing the petition filed by the former minister for interior Sheikh Rashid Ahmed challenging Mr Abbasi’s appointment as special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) for being convict in ephedrine case suggested to the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to reconsider the decision of his appointment as SAPM.
After a preliminary hearing, the court directed the Cabinet Division secretary to “place the matter before the prime minister.
In case the conviction has not been set aside then the prime minister will be expected to reconsider the appointment of Respondent No 2 [Hanif Abbasi].”
Suggests PM to reconsider his appointment
The petition pointed out that the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) on July 21, 2012 registered FIR against Abbasi under Section 9-C, 14 and 15 of the Control of Narcotics Substance Act, 1997 for selling 500kg ephedrine to drug smugglers instead of using the controlled chemical in medicine, etc.
The CNS court on July 21, 2018 found Abbasi guilty of selling 500kg of ephedrine to narcotics smugglers and imposed a fine of Rs1 million on the PML-N leader along with the life sentence.
Seven other accused were acquitted in the case.
The sentence, however, was suspended in April 2019 while appeal against conviction is still pending before the Lahore High Court.
The court noted that “suspension of the sentence by an appellate court does not in any manner affect the conviction. The distinction between “conviction” and “sentence” has been highlighted in the judgement passed by the Supreme Court in the case of Nawaz Sharif that discussed the President’s power to pardon the convict.
The apex court has held that effect of grant of pardon, even in full, was not the same as an order of acquittal by a court of law.
“In the case in hand, it appears that the appeal against the conviction is pending before the learned Lahore Hiigh Court while sentence has been suspended” the court order states adding “the conviction, therefore, remains undisturbed.”
The court observed: “If so, then it, prima facie, appears that a person cannot hold a public office as long as the conviction has not been set aside by a competent court through a judicial process.”
Further hearing in this matter has been adjourned till May 17.
Sheikh Rashid in the petition had pointed out that the LHC vide order dated April 11, 2019 “only suspended the sentence of the Respondent No. 2 [Abbasi] and not the conviction” adding that “the conviction stood intact for all intents and purposes.”
Explaining the difference between the conviction and suspension of sentence, the petition stated that “in criminal jurisprudence, there is indeed a marked difference between conviction and sentence. Conviction is finding someone guilty positively of the offence(s) charged with whereas sentence is the punishment (imprisonment or fine or both) for being guilty of that offence.
Subsequently, Abbasi “is disqualified from holding the public office”, the petition said.
It said “in the middle of April 2022, due to change in regime, a new government was formed and Respondent No 2 was appointed as the special assistant to the prime minister.”
The petition termed the appointment as illegal, unlawful and unconstitutional as he is inherently disqualified from holding this prestigious public office.”
The petition requested the court to set aside the notification for the appointment of Mr Abbasi as SAPM.

The Cyber Crime Wing of the Federal Investigation Agency had taken the suspect, Fayyazuddin, a resident of Tehkal area in Peshawar city, into custody on Sunday.
He had shared the video clip from his Twitter account.
The FIA officials produced him before judicial magistrate Sher Hassan and insisted that the detainee was held for uploading a deepfake video of the PML-N’s woman leader on social media.
Court turns down FIA’s physical remand plea
The agency sought two days physical custody of the suspect. However, the court turned the request down and ordered the sending of the accused to the jail on a 14 days judicial remand.
A FIA official told Dawn that the suspect was held over the sharing of a deepfake video of the PML-N leader performing a belly dance.
He said that the suspect also used his Twitter account for spreading propaganda against the Pakistan Army.
The FIR registered against the suspect read that the inquiry conducted by the FIA ‘established the accused with mala-fide intentions and ulterior motives, started highly obnoxious intimidating campaign through his Twitter account against Maryam Nawaz’.
“The alleged Twitter account was used to intimidate and spoil the modesty of the victim lady by transmission of sexually explicit, objectionable and fabricated video,” it said.
The FIR added that it was established during the course of inquiry that Fayyazuddin was operating that Twitter account.
The FIA booked the accused under sections 21 and 24 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, and Section 509 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Also in the day, the PTI workers staged a protest outside the Peshawar Press Club against the arrest of the suspect.
Former Peshawar district nazim Mohammad Asim Khan and PTI Peshawar city coordinator Irfan Saleem led the protesters, who shouted slogans against the PML-N-led federal government and demanded immediate release of the detainee.
Mr Asim said that Mr Fayyazuddin was an active social media activist of the PTI.
Mr Saleem criticised the arrest and said that the ‘imported’ federal government even lacked the ‘guts to digest criticism’.
He also said that the arrest of the PTI worker was an attack on the freedom of speech, which was guaranteed by the Constitution.
The PTI leader said that all party activists were ready to go to the jail and stage street protests to further ‘their cause’.
“In what capacity, the state is defending Maryam Nawaz, who is a private individual,” he said.

Talking to this scribe by telephone on Monday, neighbourhood council chairman Engineer Latifullah Khan from Lakki Marwat, Kisan councillor Riffatullah Quraishi from Bannu and others said that the first phase of local government elections was held in December last but the elected members were still unaware of their functions and responsibilities.
They said that despite the lapse of over four months, the powers had not been devolved to grassroots level, causing numerous problems.
“The local government representatives are unable to launch development works in their respective areas due to unavailability of funds although they have taken oath of their offices,” said Rifatuullah.
He asked the government to arrange training sessions for members of local bodies to inform them about their duties, responsibilities and powers.
ARREST: Three transporters were arrested for overcharging commuters in Bannu on Monday.
An official said that the district administration launched a crackdown on transporters after receiving complaints that they were fleecing commuters.
He said that many people including government employees turned up at bus terminals to go to their workplaces in public transport vehicles after spending Eid with their families. “The transporters created shortage of vehicles to charge passengers according to their will,” he added.
He said that officials visited bus terminals in Bannu and check availability of vehicles there. “The administration officials also intercepted public transport vehicles on main arteries and talked to passengers about fares they had paid to the transporters,” he added.
The official said that three transporters were arrested when passengers complained about non-implementation of the official fare list. “Police accompanying the administration officials shifted the arrested men to police station and registered a case against them,” he added.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2355906/foreign-funding-pti-raises-objections-over-pml-n-ppp-records,2022-05-10,tribune,national,"Foreign funding: PTI raises objections over PML-N, PPP records","The PTI counsel, while giving arguments before the ECP scrutiny committee, has raised objections, saying the major political parties – namely PPP and PML-N – are still dilly-dallying over submission of their records of alleged illegal funding.
In a meeting of the election supervisor’s scrutiny committee held on Monday, the PTI deplored that four years had passed since the panel was formed in 2018 yet the PML-N and PPP had not submitted their records, claiming that both the parties received “illicit” funding.
PML-N lawyer Jahangir Khan Jadoon and PTI counsel Rana Muhammad Afzal appeared before the committee.
Talking to the media after attending the meeting of the scrutiny committee, PTI Information Secretary Farrukh Habib stressed that the party has requested the commission to adjudicate upon the matter without delaying it any further, adding that it was the duty of the election supervisor to enforce the law.
The PTI leader emphasised that the ECP had to decide the matter within a period of 30 days. “We have raised our objections today which will be looked into by the scrutiny committee,” he added.
“Late Benazir Bhutto had revealed in her book that Nawaz Sharif received money from al Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden to contest elections against her in 1990,” he said. ""The PPP and the PML-N concealed their accounts, whereas our record is clean and transparent,” he claimed.
Read ECP to hear foreign funding case before Eid holidays
Referring to the former ruling party’s dissident lawmakers – against whom the PTI had approached the ECP seeking their disqualification for violating party principle – Farrukh said: “Tomorrow (Tuesday), the ECP will hold an important hearing on those who sold their conscience. If the dissident members partook [in the no-confidence vote against former prime minister Imran Khan], then it merits direct disqualification of the lawmakers.”
‘PTI kept delaying the matter’
Meanwhile, PML-N lawyer Jahangir Jadoon, speaking to the media, claimed that ever since the constitution of the scrutiny committee, the PTI had been deploying delaying tactics.
He said that the PML-N had submitted its record to the panel, adding that not a single cheque the party received was illegal.
The foreign funding case was pending since Nov 14, 2014, and it was filed by Akbar S Babar who had alleged that there were financial irregularities in the PTI’s funding from Pakistan and abroad.
On January 4 this year, the ECP scrutiny committee, formed in March 2018, submitted its report on the PTI’s foreign funding case after 95 hearings.",1,1,0.35745149692201905,2.3574514969220193
